Evaluation Procedure


Laserdaten_auswerten.m

Variables:
xs = wavelength
xse = wavelength error

ys = traces for all C_60He_n
yse = accompanying errors

ysmax = Highest yield for each trace
ysmin = Lowest yield for each trace

names = Name for each Column

x0 = fit starting values
l = number of traces

Procedure:
1) Load data
2) Determine highest and lowest yield of each trace
3) Normalize each trace. For each trace, the lowest yield of the trace is subtracted and then it is divided by the difference between highest and lowest yield (value span of trace). This results in values between 0 and 1.
4) Normalize each error trace by dividing all errors by the span of values for the trace (relative errors).
5) Loop over all traces and... 
	5a) Smooth data with a window of 1nm (default) - then get minimum for fit starting parameter.
	5b) fit each one with the given function (typically Lorentzian). 
	5c) calculate errors for the trace
